        "Question 1: What is Simple Linear Regression (SLR)? Explain its purpose.\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a statistical technique used to understand the relationship between two continuous variables — one independent variable (predictor) and one dependent variable (target).\n",
        "It fits a straight line that best represents the relationship between them and helps in predicting the value of the dependent variable based on the independent variable.\n",
        "Purpose:\n",
        "•\tTo identify the strength and direction of the relationship between variables.\n",
        "•\tTo make predictions using the linear equation.\n",
        "•\tTo understand how one variable affects another.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 2: What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "The key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression are:\n",
        "1.\tLinearity: The relationship between the independent and dependent variable is linear.\n",
        "2.\tIndependence: The residuals (errors) are independent of each other.\n",
        "3.\tHomoscedasticity: The variance of residuals is constant across all levels of the independent variable.\n",
        "4.\tNormality: The residuals are normally distributed.\n",
        "5.\tNo multicollinearity: (Applies to multiple regression) Independent variables should not be highly correlated.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 3: Write the mathematical equation for a simple linear regression model and explain each term.\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "Equation:\n",
        "Y = β₀ + β₁X + ε\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "•\tY: Dependent variable (output or target)\n",
        "•\tX: Independent variable (input or predictor)\n",
        "•\tβ₀: Intercept — value of Y when X = 0\n",
        "•\tβ₁: Slope — change in Y for a one-unit increase in X\n",
        "•\tε: Error term — represents the difference between actual and predicted values\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 4: Provide a real-world example where simple linear regression can be applied.\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "A real-world example is predicting house prices based on house size.\n",
        "Here,\n",
        "•\tX (independent variable): Size of the house (in square feet)\n",
        "•\tY (dependent variable): House price\n",
        "The regression line helps estimate the price of a house based on its size.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 5: What is the method of least squares in linear regression?\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "The method of least squares is used to find the best-fitting regression line by minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals (differences between actual and predicted values).\n",
        "Formula:\n",
        "Minimize Σ (from i = 1 to n) [ Yi(actual) − Yi(predicted) ]²\n",
        "This ensures that the fitted line passes as close as possible to all the data points, minimizing overall error.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 6: What is Logistic Regression? How does it differ from Linear Regression?\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification problems where the output variable is categorical (e.g., Yes/No, 0/1). It predicts the probability that a sample belongs to a specific class using the logistic (sigmoid) function.\n",
        "Differences:\n",
        "Aspect\tLinear Regression\tLogistic Regression\n",
        "Output\tContinuous value\tProbability (0–1)\n",
        "Purpose\tPredict quantities\tClassify categories\n",
        "Function\tLinear function\tSigmoid/logistic function\n",
        "Error Metric\tMean Squared Error\tLog Loss / Cross-Entropy\n",
        "Range of Output\t(−∞, +∞)\t0 to 1\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 7: Name and briefly describe three common evaluation metrics for regression models.\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "Three commonly used evaluation metrics are:\n",
        "1.\t Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\n",
        "It measures the average magnitude of errors between actual and predicted values, without considering their direction.\n",
        "Formula:\n",
        "MAE = (1 / n) * Σ (from i = 1 to n) | Yi(actual) − Yi(predicted) |\n",
        "\n",
        "2.\tMean Squared Error (MSE)\n",
        "It measures the average of squared differences between actual and predicted values. Squaring penalizes larger errors more.\n",
        "Formula:Σ (from i = 1 to n) [ Yi(actual) − Yi(predicted) ]²\n",
        "\n",
        "3.\t Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n",
        "It is the square root of MSE and expresses the error in the same units as the dependent variable.\n",
        "Formula:\n",
        "RMSE = √[ (1 / n) * Σ (from i = 1 to n) [ Yi(actual) − Yi(predicted) ]² ]\n",
        "\n",
        "Lower MAE, MSE, and RMSE values indicate better model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 8: What is the purpose of the R-squared metric in regression analysis?\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "The R-squared (R²) metric measures how well the regression model explains the variance in the dependent variable. It shows the proportion of total variation in Y that is explained by X.\n",
        "Formula:\n",
        "R² = 1 − [ Σ (from i = 1 to n) ( Yi(actual) − Yi(predicted) )² / Σ (from i = 1 to n) ( Yi(actual) − Ȳ )² ]\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "•\tȲ = Mean of actual values\n",
        "•\tNumerator: Unexplained variance (residual error)\n",
        "•\tDenominator: Total variance\n",
        "An R² value closer to 1 indicates a better fit, meaning the model explains most of the data variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 10: How do you interpret the coefficients in a simple linear regression model?\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "In the regression equation Y = β₀ + β₁X:\n",
        "•\tIntercept (β₀): The predicted value of Y when X = 0.\n",
        "•\tSlope (β₁): Represents how much Y changes for a one-unit increase in X.\n",
        "o\tIf β₁ > 0, Y increases as X increases.\n",
        "o\tIf β₁ < 0, Y decreases as X increases.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "If β₀ = 2 and β₁ = 0.6, then for each additional unit increase in X, Y increases by 0.6 units.\n"
