        "Q1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "A:\n",
        "•\tCompiled languages are translated into machine code before execution (e.g., C, C++).\n",
        "•\tInterpreted languages are translated line-by-line during execution (e.g., Python).\n",
        "•\tPython is an interpreted language.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",

        "\n",
        "Q3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "A:\n",
        "The finally block is used to execute code no matter what—whether an exception occurred or not. It is typically used for cleanup actions like closing files.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "A:\n",
        "Logging is a built-in module in Python used to record messages (info, warnings, errors, etc.) during program execution, useful for debugging and monitoring.\n",

        "Q8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "A:\n",
        "with ensures the file is automatically closed, even if an error occurs. It's a context manager:\n",
        "with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:\n",

        "•\tMultiprocessing: multiple processes (independent memory).\n",
        "•\tMultiprocessing is better for CPU-bound tasks; threading is better for I/O-bound tasks.\n",

        "Q16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "A:\n",
